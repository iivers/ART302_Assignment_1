  <b>For this cheats's tiramisu, I used condenced milk in a mascarpone cream rather than eggs, which would be more tradtional but also more time-consuming. The milk brings a silky sweetness that goes beautifly with the chocolate, and it still ticks all the boxes for texture and flavor. If you're entertaining, make these ahead of time and leave them in the fridge until you are ready to serve.</b>
